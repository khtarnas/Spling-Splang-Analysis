The final project for LING270. My partners and I sent out a google form to our friends about the sound of different words based on different linguistic principles. This is an analysis in which I did statistical analyses (for example t-stats) using python to figure out whether there was any significant evidence for linguistic preferences. 

The experiment was a recreation of a previously done and published one. Link to original experiment: https://www.jstor.org/stable/413574
